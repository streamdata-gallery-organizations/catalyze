description: Catalyze exists to help healthcare transition to value-based patient
  care. We aid the innovators by enabling them to focus on their innovation, not compliance
  or integration. Catalyze is built by healthcare and security veterans with a deep
  understanding to what it takes to make you successful. We aren&rsquo;t healthcare-friendly,
  we are healthcare-only. Catalyze raises the value of digital health data and applications
  by making them secure, trustworthy, and interoperable with other health systems.
  We align and amplify your model.
